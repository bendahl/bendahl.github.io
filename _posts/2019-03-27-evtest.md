title: Using evtest to test Linux input drivers
---

As I've learned over the course of working on the [uinput project](https://github.com/bendahl/uinput), testing input drivers on Linux can be tricky, but there's a little tool that makes live a lot easier: [evtest](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/evtest.1.html). The tool itself is really easy to use. Given that you've got evtest installed on your system, all it takes are three basic steps to perform some tests:

1. enter `sudo evtest`
2. Select your device from the list. Once you've selected your device, some basic information about the device under test will be displayed. You should see output similar to this:
```
Input driver version is 1.0.1
Input device ID: bus 0x3 vendor 0x4711 product 0x816 version 0x1
Input device name: "Test Basic Mouse"
Supported events:
  Event type 0 (EV_SYN)
  Event type 1 (EV_KEY)
    Event code 272 (BTN_LEFT)
    Event code 273 (BTN_RIGHT)
  Event type 2 (EV_REL)
    Event code 0 (REL_X)
    Event code 1 (REL_Y)
Properties:
Testing ... (interrupt to exit)
```
What we actually see above is a relative axis event device (like a mouse) that also supports right and left button events (for right and left click).


3. Perform your tests and watch the output. Example output:
```
Event: time 1553716465.011316, type 2 (EV_REL), code 0 (REL_X), value -100
Event: time 1553716465.011316, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------
Event: time 1553716465.011869, type 2 (EV_REL), code 0 (REL_X), value 150
Event: time 1553716465.011869, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------
Event: time 1553716465.012304, type 2 (EV_REL), code 1 (REL_Y), value -50
Event: time 1553716465.012304, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------
Event: time 1553716465.012699, type 2 (EV_REL), code 1 (REL_Y), value 100
Event: time 1553716465.012699, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------
Event: time 1553716465.013147, type 1 (EV_KEY), code 273 (BTN_RIGHT), value 1
Event: time 1553716465.013147, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------
Event: time 1553716465.013532, type 1 (EV_KEY), code 273 (BTN_RIGHT), value 0
Event: time 1553716465.013532, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------
Event: time 1553716465.013825, type 1 (EV_KEY), code 272 (BTN_LEFT), value 1
Event: time 1553716465.013825, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------
Event: time 1553716465.014199, type 1 (EV_KEY), code 272 (BTN_LEFT), value 0
Event: time 1553716465.014199, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------
Event: time 1553716465.014492, type 1 (EV_KEY), code 272 (BTN_LEFT), value 1
Event: time 1553716465.014492, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------
Event: time 1553716465.014774, type 1 (EV_KEY), code 272 (BTN_LEFT), value 0
Event: time 1553716465.014774, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------
Event: time 1553716465.014862, type 1 (EV_KEY), code 273 (BTN_RIGHT), value 1
Event: time 1553716465.014862, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------
Event: time 1553716465.015150, type 1 (EV_KEY), code 273 (BTN_RIGHT), value 0
Event: time 1553716465.015150, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------
```

The example output shows various mouse moves (the EV_REL events) as well as a couple of clicks, or - more precisely - button events (EV_KEY). The SYN_REPORT synchronizes events and may also be used to group events that should occur at the same moment in time (for more details see: [kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/input/event-codes.txt).

That's all. Plain and simple. Yet another amazing little helper in this vast Linux universe. More to follow...
