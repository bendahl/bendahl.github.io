### Who am I?

I'm a software developer who's always looking to learn something new and interested in understanding how things work. I started tinkering with computers and programming when I was still a kid, fascinated by this intricate machinery. Over the years I've been fortunate enough to work in different companies, industries and even countries, always learning new and intersting things as I go. And even after all these years there's still a lot to learn. It's a continuous and exciting experience. This is what really makes IT and Computer Science so different. It just never gets boring and there's always something new to discover.

Feel free to browse my Github repos, comment, make suggestions, create pull requests, etc... Feedback and ideas are always welcome. The only rule being: Be constructive!
